# Question 3(i)
#  Write a Python program that prompts a user to enter numbers. The process will repeat until
#  the user enters 0. Finally, the program prints sum of the numbers entered by the user.

# Question 3(ii)
# Write a Python program to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are not divisible by 2

#number = int(input())
number = 100
print (number)
not_divisible = number('!/2')
while number is {not_divisible}:
